During my internship at Cleveland Clinic, I had the privilege of collaborating with PhD cancer researcher Arda Durmaz to develop an innovative solution in the field of medical technology. This partnership led to the creation of our [NGS Pipeline](https://github.com/ardadurmaz/ngs-var), a cutting-edge automated oncology pipeline utilizing Next-Generation Sequencing technology. This tool is specifically designed to advance cancer research and treatment, showcasing our commitment to leveraging technology for meaningful medical advancements.
