During my internship at Cleveland Clinic, I collaborated with PhD cancer researcher Arda Durmaz to develop an innovative medical technology solution. We created the [NGS Pipeline](https://github.com/ardadurmaz/ngs-var), an automated oncology pipeline using Next-Generation Sequencing technology. This tool aims to advance cancer research and treatment, reflecting our dedication to leveraging technology for meaningful medical progress.
