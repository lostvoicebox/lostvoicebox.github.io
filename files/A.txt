As a passionate K-Pop photocard collector, I sought a more organized and efficient way to manage my growing collection. This led me to create [PCollect](https://pcollect.app), a mobile app designed in SwiftUI and Xcode, tailored specifically toward K-Pop enthusiasts like myself. PCollect, now with over 25,000 downloads, incorporates computer vision for easy uploading, augmented reality for an immersive experience, and digital inventory for tracking and sharing.
