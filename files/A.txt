As a passionate K-Pop photocard collector, I developed [PCollect](https://pcollect.app), a mobile app in SwiftUI and Xcode, to organize my growing collection. With over 40,000 downloads, PCollect uses computer vision for easy uploads, augmented reality for immersive experiences, and digital inventory for tracking and sharing.

As of May 2024, PCollect is also available on Android (Kotlin).
