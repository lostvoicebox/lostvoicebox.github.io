Admittedly, I created [this film](https://youtu.be/ooUYJDFkCnY) for an English project having chosen to read Han Kang's *The White Book* based on the Google search "best short books".

Using only quotes from the book and the limited footage available of my childhood, I'd like to think that it didn't turn out half bad.
