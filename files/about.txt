Hello! I'm Theo, an alumnus of Stuyvesant High School studying Computer Science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology. This site is a collection of my techincal and creative pursuits and is itself something in between - have you ever encountered design of such caliber?

Upon reflection, it seems somewhat narcissistic to publish one's own name as a domain. My only defense is the promise that I am not.

Anyway, I hope you will find anything of interest!
