As a passionate K-Pop photocard collector, I found myself seeking a more organized and efficient way to manage my growing collection. This led to the creation of [PCollect](https://pcollect.app), a mobile app designed in SwiftUI and Xcode, tailored specifically for K-Pop enthusiasts like myself. PCollect, now with over 20,000 downloads, incorporates computer vision for easy uploading, augmented reality for an immersive experience, and digital inventory for tracking and sharing your collection. PCollect represents my commitment to enhancing the K-Pop collecting experience, blending technology with passion.
