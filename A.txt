As a passionate K-Pop photocard collector, I found myself seeking a more organized and efficient way to manage my growing collection. This led to the creation of [PCollect](https://pcollect.app), a mobile app designed in SwiftUI and Xcode, tailored specifically for K-Pop enthusiasts like myself. PCollect, now with over 20,000 downloads, offers computer vision for easy uploading, AR technology for an immersive experience, and features for tracking and sharing your collection.
